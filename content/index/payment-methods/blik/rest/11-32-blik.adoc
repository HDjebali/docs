[#blik_Workflow]
=== Workflow

[#blik_debitTransaction]
==== _debit_ Transaction

[#blik_debitPrerequisites]
===== Prerequisites

For a successful workflow, please keep the following prerequisites in
mind:

* A blik payment process is *accomplished successfully only, if {payment-gateway-abbr} has
sent out a successful notification*. The status ``success`` in the response
only confirms that the payment was technically accepted.
* In case the consumer closes the browser before confirming the payment,
there is *a redirection to shop page* possible. This means, the workflow
can be accomplished successfully, even when shutting down the browser.
* As soon as the blik landing page has been opened in a browser,
the *consumer has 15 minutes to authorize the payment*. However, the
validity of the received URL is not limited. Try to ensure that the URL
is opened by the consumer as soon as possible. In edge cases the payment
could be successfully finished even after a long time (when the merchant
could have cancelled the order already).
* The maximum period to receive notification is 30 days.

[#blik_debitProcessUsingtheReSTAPI]
===== Payment Process Using the ReST API

image::images/diagrams/blik_debit_rest.png[Payment Process Using ReST API]

. The consumer initiates a transaction (currency is set to ``PLN``).
. The merchant sends a request with the consumer's data to the
endpoint of _{payment-gateway-abbr}_.
. {payment-gateway-abbr} sends a response to the merchant.
. The merchant redirects the consumer to the blik landing page (The URL
for redirection is in the response message, field
``payment-methods/payment-method/@url``).
. The consumer authorizes the transaction.
. {payment-gateway-abbr} performs two actions simultaneously:
. {payment-gateway-abbr} redirects the consumer (via redirect URLs) back to the shop
where the information about the status of the payment is displayed. The
redirect URL uses the definition in ``success-redirect-url`` and
``fail-redirect-url`` from the request (Step 2). According to success or
failure during the payment process {payment-gateway-abbr} sends the consumer to the
corresponding URL. This is the page where the consumer is informed about
his successful or failed payment.
. {payment-gateway-abbr} sends a notification (IPN) of the payment outcome. In order to
receive server-to-server notification, the notification must use the
definition in the field ``notifications/notification/@url`` in the request
(Step 2)

[#blik_debitProcessUsingthePaymentPage]
===== Payment Process Using the Payment Page

.Payment Process Using Payment Page
image::images/diagrams/blik_debit_pp.png[Payment Process Using Payment Page]

. The consumer initiates a transaction (currency is set to PLN).
. The merchant sends a request with the consumer's data to the
endpoint of _{payment-gateway-abbr}_.
. {payment-gateway-abbr} analyses the consumer's data.
.. If the request does not include the payment method blik, the _{payment-gateway-abbr}_
redirects the consumer to Payment Page
... The consumer selects blik.
... {payment-gateway-abbr} redirects the consumer to the blik landing page.
.. If the request already includes the payment method blik, _{payment-gateway-abbr}_
redirects the consumer to the blik landing page.
. The consumer selects the desired bank.
. The consumer authorizes the transaction.
. {payment-gateway-abbr} performs two actions simultaneously:
.. {payment-gateway-abbr} redirects the consumer (via redirect URLs) back to the shop
where the information about the status of the payment is displayed. The
redirect URL uses the definition
in ``success-redirect-url`` and ``fail-redirect-url`` from the request (Step
2). According to success or failure during the payment process {payment-gateway-abbr} sends
the consumer to the corresponding URL. This is the page where the
consumer is informed about his successful or failed payment.
.. {payment-gateway-abbr} sends a notification (IPN) of the payment outcome. In order to
receive a server-to-server notification, the notification must use the
definition in the field ``notifications/notification/@url`` in the request
(Step 2).

[#blik_refundTransaction]
==== _refund_ Transaction

A ``refund`` transaction is a backend process. Getnet can only provide a
process for ReST API. When using Payment Page the merchant must set up a
refund process.

[#blik_refundPrerequisites]
===== Prerequisites

In order to transfer funds back to the consumer you have to be aware of
the following prerequisites:

* The flow is asynchronous. You have to wait for a notification with the
result. Usually it takes one day for refunds to be processed.
* The _refund_ must reference to a successful ``debit`` transaction. In a
_refund_, a _Transaction ID_ from a ``debit`` notification must be
used.
* The refunded amount must be less than or equal to original ``debit``
transaction
* Multiple refunds to a single ``debit`` are possible as long as the sum
of those individual refunds does not exceed original full amount.
* In order to have a final status of the _refund_, you have to process a
subsequent notification.

[#blik_refundProcessUsingtheReSTAPI]
===== _refund_ Process Using the ReST API

.refund Process Using the ReST API
image::images/diagrams/blik_refund_rest.svg[refund Process Using the ReST API]

. The merchant initiates a ``refund`` transaction.
. The merchant sends a request to the endpoint of _{payment-gateway-abbr}_. The request
must contain:
.. the _Request ID_ from a previously sent successful ``debit``
transaction. The _Request ID_ is expected in the
field ``parent-transaction-id``
.. a ``payment-methods/payment-method/@name`` set to ``blik``
.. a ``transaction-type`` set to ``refund-request``
. {payment-gateway-abbr} sends a response to the merchant.
. blik processes the refund.
+
NOTE: Processing a refund lasts at least one day!

+
. {payment-gateway-abbr} waits for the status "Refund Process Finished".
. {payment-gateway-abbr} sends a notification (IPN) of the ``refund`` outcome to the
merchant. This notification has the transaction type ``refund-debit``,
instead of ``refund-request`` which was sent in the merchant's request
(Step 2).  +
In order to receive a server-to-server notification, the notification
must use the definition in the
field ``notifications/notification/@url`` in the request (Step 2).
See <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN, Instant Payment Notification>> for details.

[#blik_void-debit]
==== void-debit

Void debit flow:  When timeout occurs during void-debit processing and Blik confirms that the void-debit processing is still in progress, the core logic will create an XML response with the void debit in ‘failed’ state  but in fact the void-debit tx will remain in progress in EE DB.
To identify if the void-debit is actually failed, Merchant will need to check if there is an error block.
- If it exists, then the void-debit failed and the corresponding error will be sent
- if it doesn't exist, then void-debit is still being processed and its state is 'in progress'
Where a transaction that carried recurring payment/subscription registration request has been voided, a subsequent recurring transactions will not be accepted.

Merchants should be careful about providing the values for non-srting parameters (i.e. date/integer/float, etc)  since they can be converted incorrectly. Currently if the value cannot be converted to an expected format (e.g. Merchant provider Mar 30th and it should be converted to MM-DD-YYYY), it will be replaced with NULL. Until a solution is found to fix it, Merchants should ensure they send correct values

The <recurring-plan> block has been added to Payment Gateway API with the following fields:


[cols="e,,,,"]
|===
|Field |Cardinality |Datatype |Size |Description

|recurring-plan-id |O |String |36 |It is planed for future reuse and not used at the moment

|program-id |O |String |36 |Provide value for provider-id

For Blik auto-payments, the value should be 64 chartacters max and unambiguous across entire Merchant's system.

|plan-type |O |String|36 |Plan type that can be used to provide a type of subscription or subscription code

For Blik auto-payments, it should be PAYID

|plan-sub-type |O |String |36 |For Blik, model of recurring payment/subscription:

A when the Merchant requires recurring transactions with fixed amount to be authorized by the Issuer automatically (without confirmation by a Consumer in the banking application)

M when the Merchant requires recurring transactions with variable amount to be uthorized by the Issuer after it has been confirmed by a Consumer in the banking application.

|recurring-payment-amount |O |Decimal |18,6 |Indicates fixed amount of a single recurring transaction

|recurring-payment-amount/@currency|O |String |3|
The currency of the requested recurring transaction amount
Format: 3-character abbreviation according to ISO 4217.

|total-payment-amount |O |Decimal |18,6|Indicates total value that is the upper limit value until the recuring payment expiration date. It is calculated by the Issuer when a Consumer changes recurring payment/subscription expiration date

Format: 3-character abbreviation according to ISO 4217.

|total-number-of-payments |O |Integer |3|The total maximum number of all recurring transactions that will be executed under a given recurring payment/subscription (suggested by Merchant). For Blik, it is currently not used

|recurring-expire-date |O |date |3|The date before which the Merchant wants to have the ability to send recurring transactions authorization requests within a given recurring payment/subscription.
For Blik, it is displayed to a Consumer.
For plan-sub-type A, the expiry date must be specified and may not exceed 10 years

|recurring-expire-date-mode |O |String |20|For Bllit, it indicates recurring payment validity expiry date mode.

When the following value is provided, then a Consumer cannot shorten the validity expiry date
MIN

i.e. the Consumer can’t change the expiration date of the recurring payment to a smaller one than specified in this field; when there is no MIN , the Consumer may either increase or decrease the proposed expiration date; change of the validity date by the Consumer results in the necessity of converting total-payment-amount by the Issuer

For Blik, it is displayed to a Consumer at the stage of creating the recurring payment/subscription, not editable

|recurring-descriptor |O |String |35|Recurring payment/subscription label/descriptor. e.g. the payment in accordance with the Agreement no ….” and Internet website address / Merchant’s brand (maximum 35 characters) If it contains personal data (e.g. e-mail address), that should be sending partly anonymised data, for instance, jan.kowalski@wp.pl -> ja…ki@wp…pl. jan.kowalski@poczta.onet.pl -> ja..ki@po...pl The rule: all the characters must be shortened by means of replacing them with three dots except for the first and last two ones. If the sequence of characters contains @, both parts of the chain divided by @, it must be shortened by means of the same method

|recurring-no-delay |O |boolean ||In the case of a negative authorization with a refusal code indicating that the reason was a lack of funds, the Merchant may repeat the authorization request with the noDelay flag raised, which indicates to the Issuer that it should make the authorization as soon as possible.

|sequence-type |O |Enumeration|20|Indicates the phase of subscription or a recurring transaction
Possible values:

register (It is used for subscription registration)

recurring (It is used for recurring/periodic transactions)

update (it is used for subscription update or renewal)
